# Train-Routes

Simulation of train routes that will determine the shortest route for a train to pick-up and deliver railroad cars on a large railway network. Given trainRunner.cpp, the tester file, and CreateFile.cpp that creates random test files with different loads and destinations. 

Solution: Used dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths from train to station. Used binary heap to store stations' information.
